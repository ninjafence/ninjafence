# NinjaFence Project

NinjaFence is a low-cost automated table saw fence controller. Table saws are one of the most commonly used woodworking machines, and being able to modify the table saw fence is very interesting for an engineer who loves woodworking, and this idea came out since 2018, the solution of hardware and software was changed many times intermittently, and finally designed this way for easier use and low cost.
